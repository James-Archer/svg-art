#svg-art

Inspired by the talk by Amanda Hogan at PyConAU 2019 and art code stolen from https://github.com/hogesonline/svg_play.

This aims to be a react app as a front-end with a flask server on the back-end that generates the art. The flask app *should* also just work by iteself (with appropriate GET and POST calls).

## Requirements

Python 3.7

Node and stuff

## Installation

Create and activate a virtualenv

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd react-app

npm install

## Running

Activate venv

Flask

export FLASK_APP=svg_server.py OR set FLASK_APP=svg_server.py (Windows)

flask run

### React

cd react-app

npm start

And that's it...?
